# scMuscle

## The Cornell Single-Cell Muscle Project (scMuscle) aims to collect, analyze and provide to the research community skeletal muscle transcriptomic data.

We used more than 100 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets, from 14 different research groups, to build an integrated transcriptomic reference of murine skeletal muscle. 
The resulting compendium has ~350,000 cell/nucleus, which we have annotated using a suite of existing software tools (see linked preprint for more details). 

Here, you'll find all of the R scripts used for the analysis as well as some of the supplemental resources (including metadata details, outputs from differential gene expression analysis, and some other useful gene lists).
