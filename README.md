# scMuscle

## The Cornell Single-Cell Muscle Project (scMuscle) aims to collect, analyze, and provide to the research community skeletal muscle transcriptomic data.

We used more than 100 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets, from 14 different research groups, to build an integrated transcriptomic reference of murine skeletal muscle.
The resulting compendium has ~365,000 cell/nucleus, which we have annotated using a suite of existing software tools (see linked preprint for more details).

Here, you'll find all of the R scripts used for the analysis and visualization (`R_scripts/`) as well as some of the supplemental resources we generated (`supplemental_data/`). These resources include metadata details, outputs from differential gene expression analysis, and some other useful gene lists.

You will also find the development version of the code used in our [web application](http://scmuscle.bme.cornell.edu/)(`web_app/`), as well as details on different versions of the data (`data_versions/`)

**Code and supplemental data from McKellar et al, *bioRxiv*, 2020:**

**Web application to explore these data can be found [here](http://scmuscle.bme.cornell.edu/)**

**Raw data from Spatial RNA sequencing (Visium) can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE161318)**

*Raw sequencing data for new 10x Chromium datasets will be made available on GEO soon!*
