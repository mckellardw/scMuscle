Here are some examples of follow-up analyses we have done with the scMuscle dataset.

## `hedgehog_Norris_et_al`
This work, in collaboration with [the Kopinke lab at UF](https://www.kopinkelab.com/), used the scMuscle dataset to identify which cell types are involved in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling after acute muscle injury.

## `Lee_Tead-Apelin_iScience_2022.Rmd`
This work, led by Umji Lee, used the scMuscle data to look at cell-type-specific expression of APln, Aplnr, and Tead1  during muscle injury response.
