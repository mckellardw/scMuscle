## Supplemental Data

- Metadata for all samples used in our analyses:
`sample_metadata_SupFile1.csv` (*see*  `scMuscle/data_versions/` *for historical versions of this file*)

- Differential gene expression results (celltype markers) for all cell types, including myogenic cell subsets: `scMuscle_harmonytypes_plus_phatebins_markers_SupFile2.csv`

- Differential gene expression results across myogenic cell subsets: `myo_phate_bins_markers_SupFile3.csv`

- Differential gene expression results across FAP  subsets: `FAP_markers_SupFile4.csv`

- Differential gene expression results across endothelial cell subsets: `endothelial_markers_SupFile5.csv`

- Differential gene expression results across myeloid cell subsets: `myeloid_markers_SupFile6.csv`

- Differential gene expression results between cells and nuclei: `cell_nucleus_markers_SupFile7.csv`
 *Note- results show expression in cells ("pct.1") over nuclei ("pct.2")*

- `gene_lists` contains a series of gene sets that we have found useful (from our analyses and others' work)
  - Panel of (canonical) marker genes used to annotate cell types in mouse skeletal muscle: `scMuscle_markers_v1.csv`
  - List of surface marker genes, taken from the [Cell Surface Protein Atlas](https://wlab.ethz.ch/cspa/): `mouse_cspa_surfaceome_proteins.csv`
  - Panel of genes associated with dissociation-induced stress, as identified in [Machado et al, *Cell Stem Cell*, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2021.01.017): `stress_core_machado_2021.txt`
  - List of transcription factor genes, taken from the [MGI Gene Ontology Project](http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/GO/project.shtml). Used the term "DNA-binding transcription factor activity". (***Note***, See [here](http://www.informatics.jax.org/go/term/GO:0003700) for an updated list.): `GO_term_summary_20191104_112842_TFlist.csv`
