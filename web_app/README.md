# [scMuscle Explorer](http://scmuscle.bme.cornell.edu/)

### Developed by Leo Song

The goal of this resource is to make our analysis available to the greater skeletal muscle community. Our tool enables the exploration of gene expression and other metadata features across each cell population. We are also focused on providing features like publication-quality figures to download, so that this tool can be used by other researchers for proposals, hypothesis generation, and general exploration of skeletal muscle transcriptomics!
