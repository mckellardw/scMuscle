# Downloads of the output files for the Visium database

Each .zip contains the outputs from the [spaceranger count](https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/count) pipeline (from 10x Genomics), minus the .bam files to reduce download size.

Raw fastqs can be downloaded from GEO [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE161318).
